        1. Behavior-driven development: Behavior-driven development (BDD) is a software development process that encourages collaboration among developers, quality assurance experts, and customer representatives in a software project. It encourages teams to use conversation and concrete examples to formalize a shared understanding of how the application should behave. It emerged from test-driven development (TDD) and can work alongside an agile software development process. Behavior-driven development combines the general techniques and principles of TDD with ideas from domain-driven design and object-oriented analysis and design to provide software development and management teams with shared tools and a shared process to collaborate on software development.<br /><br />
        2. Design-driven development: Design-driven development (DDD) places design at the forefront of product creation. Rather than treating design as a mere aesthetic afterthought, DDD emphasizes its pivotal role in dictating the direction and functionality of software.<br /><br />
        3. Domain-driven design: Domain-Driven Design is an approach to software development that centers the development on programming a domain model that has a rich understanding of the processes and rules of a domain. The name comes from a 2003 book by Eric Evans that describes the approach through a catalog of patterns. Since then a community of practitioners have further developed the ideas, spawning various other books and training courses. The approach is particularly suited to complex domains, where a lot of often-messy logic needs to be organized.<br /><br />
        4. Secure by design: Secure by Design products are those where the security of the customers is a core business requirement, not just a technical feature. Secure by Design principles should be implemented during the design phase of a product’s development lifecycle to dramatically reduce the number of exploitable flaws before they are introduced to the market for broad use or consumption.<br /><br />
        5. Test-driven development: Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases. This is as opposed to software being developed first and test cases created later. <br /><br />
        6. Acceptance test-driven development: Acceptance test–driven development (ATDD) is a development methodology based on communication between the business customers, the developers, and the testers. ATDD encompasses many of the same practices as specification by example (SBE), behavior-driven development (BDD), example-driven development (EDD), and support-driven development also called story test–driven development (SDD). All these processes aid developers and testers in understanding the customer's needs prior to implementation and allow customers to be able to converse in their own domain language.<br /><br />
        7. Continuous test-driven development: In CTDD the developer writes a test first but is not forced to execute the tests manually. The tests are run automatically by a continuous testing tool running in the background. This technique can potentially reduce the time waste resulting from manual test execution by eliminating the need for the developer to start the test after each phase of the normal TDD practice: after writing the (initially failing) test, after producing the minimal amount of code for the test to pass and after refactoring the code. <br /><br />
        8. Specification by example: Specification by example (SBE) is a collaborative approach to defining requirements and business-oriented functional tests for software products based on capturing and illustrating requirements using realistic examples instead of abstract statements. It is applied in the context of agile software development methods, in particular behavior-driven development. This approach is particularly successful for managing requirements and functional tests on large-scale projects of significant domain and organisational complexity.<br /><br />
        9. Data-driven development: The data-driven approach creates software that relies on data to guide the Product's Design, implementation, and testing. It means using data to inform decisions, validate assumptions, measure outcomes, and optimize processes. It also means collecting and analyzing data from your users, customers, competitors, and the market to understand their needs, preferences, and behaviors. Data-driven development is not just a buzzword or a trend. It's a mindset and a methodology that can help you create better software products that deliver user value to your stakeholders and solve real problems. In other words, it's a way of making your software brighter by making it more data-savvy.<br /><br />
        10. Data-oriented design: data-oriented design is a program optimization approach motivated by efficient usage of the CPU cache, often used in video game development. The approach is to focus on the data layout, separating and sorting fields according to when they are needed, and to think about transformations of data. Proponents include Mike Acton, Scott Meyers, and Jonathan Blow.
        The parallel array (or structure of arrays) is the main example of data-oriented design. It is contrasted with the array of structures typical of object-oriented designs.
        The definition of data-oriented design as a programming paradigm can be seen as contentious as many believe that it can be used side by side with another paradigm, but due to the emphasis on data layout, it is also incompatible with most other paradigms.<br /><br />
